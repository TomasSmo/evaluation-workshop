# Playwright Automated Test For Evaluation Workshop

This repo contains an automated UI test for the "Lunch App". 
This test checks the most important function of this program â€“ ordering food. The test automatically logs the user into the system, dynamically selects a day and a desired dish, and attempts to order it. It verifies whether a successful order confirmation message is received.
